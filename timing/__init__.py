"""
The timing tests use a heavily-modified version of MultiMechanize, which is a framework for running stress tests of web applications.  To test:

  #. Download the `custom version of MultiMechanize <https://github.com/jasongrout/multi-mechanize>`_
  #. Copy (or symbolic link) the ``timing`` directory into the ``projects`` directory of multi-mechanize
  #. Get the web server running
  #. Run ``python multi-mechanize.py timing`` from the multi-mechanize root directory
