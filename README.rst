This is a Sage computation web service.

Installation
============

See https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/issues/344 for current
installation instructions.

The biggest potential troublesome spot in the installation is that the
spkg has to apply two patches to Sage.  If you have uncommitted
changes, or if you have conflicts, the installation will stop.

The default configuration is not secure, so you'll need to do more
work to harden the system to open it up to outside users.  But at
least that should get you up and running for a personal/development
server.

See the :doc:`Advanced Installation <advanced_installation>`
guide for more details about configuring and running a server.

License
=======

See the :download:`LICENSE.txt <../LICENSE.txt>` file for terms and conditions for usage and a

The Sage Cell Server is designed to be compatible with recent versions of:

* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* Opera
